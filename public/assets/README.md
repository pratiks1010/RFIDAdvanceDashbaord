# Assets – logo and images

- **`logo/`** – Add your logo here. The login page footer shows **`logo.png`** (or use **`logo.svg`** by updating the image `src` in the Login page to `/assets/logo/logo.svg`).
- **`images/`** – Use this folder for any other images (icons, illustrations, etc.). Reference them in code as `/assets/images/your-file.png`.

Files in `public/assets/` are served at `/assets/` (e.g. `/assets/logo/logo.png`).
